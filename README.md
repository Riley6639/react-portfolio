# description
This is a portfolio I developed to showcase my work thus far in the bootcamp. I built it using react and its my first single-page application that i made from scratch. The website has a few different pages including an about me, project portfolio, contact form, and a resume. The navbar is easily accessable from the header of the page. In the portfolio section I included links to the deployed project and the github repository. 

# installation
This project was built using vite and several other dev dependencies listed in the package.json file. Before running the application locally make sure to run npm install. Alternativley you can visit the website here at this link: https://vermillion-bombolone-f31d8e.netlify.app/ 

# usage
To use the site, visit the link and navigate with the nav bar at the top. Everything should be pretty self explanitory

# contribution
As always contributions can be made on github or by contacting me directly. I am always excited to recieve feedback and work on improvments!

# challenges
For this project my main challenges were setting up the file structure, and styling. I had to think carefully about how I was going to set things up so that the app.jsx, and main.jsx would render things properly. After figuring that out I spent a great deal of time working on the styles to make the site look polished and clean. I think there is still some room for improvment but I believe I managed to create a well organized and clean UI that is pleasing to look at and iteract with. For future development I would like to add a loading page with some animations as well as add some more styling to the project cards.
